# AI-Powered Claims Automation & Query Response System:

An intelligent automation system that streamlines the insurance claim process — from email ingestion to claim tracking and user query handling — using **Python, PostgreSQL, JIRA API, and a RAG-based LLM.


# Project Overview:

This project automates the end-to-end claims workflow for the insurance domain.  
It eliminates manual steps like downloading claim attachments, creating JIRA tickets, and replying to user queries — replacing them with a scalable, AI-driven pipeline.

The system:
- Fetches incoming claim emails automatically.  
- Extracts relevant claim data and attachments.  
- Creates or updates JIRA tickets in real-time.  
- Stores structured claim data in PostgreSQL  
- Uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) setup with an LLM to generate context-aware, policy-driven responses for user queries.

# Key Features:

✅ Automated Claim Processing – Detects and processes claim-related emails automatically.  
✅ User Verification – Validates if the sender is a registered user before processing.  
✅ JIRA Integration – Creates or updates tickets with relevant claim details and attachments.  
✅ RAG-Based Query Resolution – Uses an LLM to provide policy-aware, context-driven answers.  
✅ Batch Job Architecture – Runs periodically and can be scaled to real-time.  
✅ Scalable & Modular Design – Easily extensible for dashboards or analytics.

# Snapshots:


1. Incoming Claim Email

The process begins when a registered user sends a claim request or query via email.
The system, integrated with Microsoft Outlook using the O365 API, automatically fetches new messages from the inbox along with their attachments (such as invoices, claim forms, or policy documents).

2. Claim Data Extraction & Processing
Extracts data from PDF attachments and updates PostgreSQL database.



3. Automated Acknowledgment & LLM-Based Reply
The LLM (RAG system) sends a policy-aware reply back to the user.



4. JIRA Ticket Creation
Automatically creates a JIRA ticket with claim description and attachments.
